# Schema Contracts

This directory is the new contract-first source for Firestore document shapes,
embedded profile objects, prompt catalogs, callable patch payloads, fixtures,
and staged storage/data migrations.

The contract runbook lives in `docs/data_contracts.md`. Start there before
changing contract scope, generator behavior, rules metadata, or migration
policy.

## Rules

- JSON Schema files use draft-07.
- Contract files describe intended persisted shape, not every legacy tolerated
  field.
- Legacy read tolerance belongs in migration notes and adapter code.
- Full Firestore documents and callable patch payloads are separate schemas.
- Firestore-specific values use `x-firestore-type` metadata. Fixture files use
  serialized timestamp objects with `_seconds` and `_nanoseconds`.
- Generated outputs must live outside `contracts/`.
- Do not hand-edit generated outputs once generator scaffolding exists.

## Contract Extensions

This repo uses a small set of `x-*` metadata fields on top of draft-07 JSON
Schema:

- `x-firestore-collection`, `x-firestore-path`, and `x-document-id-field`
  identify the live collection/path and the Dart domain field injected from a
  document id when a class stores the id outside the persisted JSON body.
- `x-firestore-type` marks persisted Firestore special values such as
  timestamps. Fixtures use serialized timestamp objects; the schema generator
  also emits an Admin SDK projection with live `FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp`
  values for Functions runtime reads.
- `x-catch-ownership` marks Firestore field ownership:
  `client-writable`, `client-runtime-writable`, `callable-owned`,
  `trigger-owned`, or `server-only`. `docs/data_contracts.md` owns the full
  lifecycle policy for these tags.
- `x-owner` is the human-readable owner summary for a document, operation, or
  migration-oriented contract. It explains who is allowed to create or mutate
  the shape at runtime.
- `x-internal-demo-fields` lists internal seed/demo metadata fields tolerated
  by a schema so production-facing contract rules can keep those fields
  visibly separated from product data.
- `x-legacy-tolerated-fields` records legacy fields accepted temporarily during
  migrations without treating them as canonical contract shape.
- `x-denormalized-to` documents projection fan-out targets that must stay in
  sync when the source document changes.
- `x-callable-aliases` records callable names that intentionally reuse a shared
  payload schema. For example, simple event-id callables can share
  `event_id_payload.schema.json` without inventing duplicate schemas.
- `x-callable-shape` records special callable payload shapes. The current
  supported value is `patch`, meaning the top-level payload wraps a required
  `fields` object whose nullable values must distinguish "omit" from
  "explicitly clear".
- `x-firestore-operation` records the direct client-write operation kind
  (`create`, `update`, or `delete`) for schemas under `contracts/client_writes/`.
- `x-logical-name` gives a direct-write schema a stable logical name when the
  current storage path is mid-migration or intentionally not the product name.
- `x-migration-phase` marks the current migration phase for a direct-write
  contract that is moving between storage paths.
- `x-storage-rules-match`, `x-storage-read`, `x-storage-write`, and
  `x-storage-rules-test-file` connect storage-path schemas to `storage.rules`
  and rules tests.
- `x-storage-content-type-pattern`, `x-storage-file-name-pattern`, and
  `x-storage-max-bytes` describe the intended client/server upload policy for a
  storage path. Rules and client helpers should reject violations before a bad
  upload completes.
- `x-storage-related-collection` and `x-storage-known-consumers` document the
  Firestore collection and app/backend surfaces that read or write a storage
  path.
- `x-storage-metadata`, `x-future-field`, and `x-migration-contract` mark
  embedded objects that describe storage assets and link them to their rollout
  plan.
- `x-catch-catalog` and `x-catch-maximumFrom` link embedded prompt values to
  catalog/business-rule sources so schema limits do not drift from product
  constants.
- `x-normalization` records callable/patch normalization rules that are enforced
  in code but still belong with the schema contract.
- `x-intentionally-excluded-fields` lists document fields intentionally omitted
  from a patch/callable contract because clients must not write them through
  that boundary.
- `x-wire-shape-extends` and `x-wire-shape-injects` record response objects
  that intentionally carry a stored document shape plus injected wire-only
  fields, such as a `publicProfiles/{uid}` body plus the document id.

## Directory Map

- `firestore/`: persisted Firestore document schemas, including document path,
  ownership, document id, demo metadata, and migration tolerance metadata.
- `shared/`: reusable schema definitions for common event, club, profile,
  timestamp, enum, id, money, and location shapes.
- `embedded/`: reusable embedded object schemas such as prompt answers and
  `ProfilePhoto` storage metadata.
- `catalogs/`: product catalogs referenced by schemas, currently profile and
  photo prompt definitions.
- `callables/`: callable Function request payload schemas.
- `callable_responses/`: callable Function response payload schemas decoded by
  typed Flutter response objects.
- `patches/`: patch-only payload schemas, currently profile updates.
- `client_writes/`: direct client-write operation payload schemas that pair
  Firestore rule behavior with schema validation.
- `storage/`: Firebase Storage path contracts for upload paths, read/write
  policy, content type, byte limits, and known consumers.
- `migrations/`: staged data/storage migration contracts and phase state.
- `fixtures/valid` and `fixtures/invalid`: schema validation fixtures consumed
  by the contract validators and parity tests.

## Current Slice

The current contract layer covers:

- shared reusable definitions under `contracts/shared/`;
- private profile documents at `users/{uid}`;
- public profile projection documents at `publicProfiles/{uid}`;
- professional host identity documents at `hostProfiles/{uid}`;
- embedded profile prompt answers;
- embedded photo prompt answers;
- embedded `ProfilePhoto` storage metadata objects;
- embedded activity preference objects, currently `activityPreferences.running`;
- profile and photo prompt catalogs;
- event, event-success, club, relationship, social, payment, safety,
  operational, and demo Firestore document contracts;
- callable request payloads for profile, event, club, review, safety, payment,
  and Places operations;
- profile patch payloads backed by typed Dart patch classes;
- selected callable response payloads that the Flutter app decodes into typed
  client response objects;
- direct client-write operation payloads for contextual profile decisions,
  chat messages, saved-event edges, notification read updates, and match unread
  resets;
- Firebase Storage path contracts for profile, club, event, and chat image
  uploads;
- migration contracts for the `profileDecisions` path, grouped `ProfilePhoto`
  storage object model, and nested profile activity preferences;
- valid and invalid fixtures for generated schema validators.

## Known Drift Captured By This Slice

- `functions/src/profiles/updateUserProfile.ts` and `firestore.rules` now use
  the contract height range of 120 to 220 cm.
- `functions/src/profiles/updateUserProfile.ts` no longer accepts legacy
  `sexualOrientation`. The profile contract does not include it.
- `firestore.rules` no longer allows new user-profile writes with legacy
  `sexualOrientation`.
- `functions/src/shared/generated/firestoreAdminTypes.ts` is the Admin SDK
  Timestamp projection, generated from JSON Schema by
  `tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs`. Functions runtime code uses
  it when Admin SDK reads return live `FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp` values.
  See `docs/data_contracts.md` "TypeScript Timestamp Projections" for when to
  use each generated TS shape.

## Validation

For the full local contract gate, run:

```bash
./tool/check_data_contract.sh
```

For the fast contract-source check, run:

```bash
node tool/contracts/validate_schema_contracts.mjs
```

This checks JSON syntax, schema metadata, local `$ref` targets, prompt catalog
uniqueness, catalog/schema limit alignment, and fixture placement. Generated
TypeScript/Ajv/Dart output is checked by `node tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs
--check` and by the full data-contract script.

Storage contract metadata is checked by:

```bash
node tool/contracts/check_storage_contract.mjs
```

## Dart Patch Classes

`UpdateUserProfilePatch` and `UpdateClubPatch` are generated patch helper
classes emitted into
`lib/core/schema_contracts/generated/callable_request_dtos.g.dart`.
The old domain paths remain compatibility exports so existing repository and
controller imports do not need to move in the same pass. Their `toJson()` output
is validated against
`contracts/patches/update_user_profile.schema.json` and
`contracts/callables/update_club_payload.schema.json` by
`test/core/update_user_profile_patch_test.dart` and
`test/core/update_club_patch_test.dart`.

Use the typed constructors for known fields. The `raw(...)` constructors remain
as temporary escape hatches for tests and genuinely dynamic migration/tooling
callers; app presentation code should route through typed patch constructors.
Remove the escape hatches once the remaining dynamic callers are migrated.

## Dart Callable Requests

Callable request classes that are safe to generate live in
`lib/core/schema_contracts/generated/callable_request_dtos.g.dart` and are
re-exported from feature-local `*_callable_dtos.dart` files. The generator
emits typed nested/domain fields for create payloads that already have stable
Dart domain objects, including `EventMeetingLocation`, `EventPolicyBundle`,
`EventFormatSnapshot`, `EventSuccessDefaults`, `EventConstraints`, and
`ClubHostDefaults`; `toJson()` on the generated request owns the final wire
shape. Feature-local adapters are responsible only for translating domain
models into those generated request constructors.

Hand-written request DTOs are still allowed when the callable boundary owns
behavior the schema alone cannot express, such as invite-code trimming,
location-bias flattening, or wrapping a generated patch helper.
