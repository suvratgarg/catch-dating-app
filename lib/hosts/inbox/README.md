# Host Inbox

Own organizer communication work: inquiry conversations, WhatsApp threads, outbound Sends, saved-audience consumption, delivery operations, and sender-readiness recovery.

## Ownership

- Primary route: `hostInboxScreen` (`/host/inbox`)
- Target root: `lib/hosts/inbox`
- Migration status: target boundary defined; implementation still lives in listed legacy Host roots
- Responsibility contract updated: 2026-09-01

Current implementation roots:

- `lib/hosts/presentation/inbox`

## This feature owns

- Own the /host/inbox destination, its Inbox and Sends peer workspaces, organizer/event scope, search, and thread selection.
- Own broadcast, announcement, campaign, follower-update, manual-send, and WhatsApp reply composition or delivery orchestration.
- Own sender setup and provider-readiness recovery for otherwise eligible sends.
- Consume saved-audience identifiers and recipient projections without recreating Audience membership logic.
- Preserve conversation drafts, send status, retries, and deep links to a selected thread.

## This feature does not own

- Customer identity, tagging, saved-audience definitions, form responses, or participant segmentation.
- Event lifecycle management, organizer profile/settings, or payment-account onboarding.
- The shared Consumer/Host chat message implementation when a dedicated chat route owns it.

## Routes

Owned routes:

- `hostInboxScreen` — `/host/inbox`
- `hostOrganizerMessagingScreen` — `/host/organizer/:clubId/messaging`

Typed handoffs:

- `hostChatScreen` — `/host/inbox/:matchId`
- `hostAudienceScreen` — `/host/audience`

## Shared dependencies

- `lib/chats/presentation/inbox` — Shared inquiry list/search presentation remains a cross-role chat implementation seam.
- `lib/hosts/presentation/host_audience_controller.dart` — Legacy campaign orchestration is relocated by A4; the responsibility remains Inbox-owned now.
- `lib/core/presentation/host_app_shell.dart` — The shell owns global destination navigation and organizer scope.

## Maintenance

Do not edit this file directly. Update `design/features/host_feature_responsibilities.json`, then run:

```sh
node tool/design/build_host_feature_responsibilities.mjs
node tool/design/build_host_feature_responsibilities.mjs --check
```

The generator cross-checks the Host shell order, typed route contract, feature-contract action owners, Dart symbols, data-contract paths, and focused tests.
