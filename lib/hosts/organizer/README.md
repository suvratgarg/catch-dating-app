# Host Organizer

Own the organizer as an operating entity: profile and media, publication readiness, defaults, Live Guide, team and host identity, payouts, insights, preview, and account-level controls.

## Ownership

- Primary route: `hostOrganizerScreen` (`/host/organizer`)
- Target root: `lib/hosts/organizer`
- Migration status: target boundary defined; implementation still lives in listed legacy Host roots
- Responsibility contract updated: 2026-09-02

Current implementation roots:

- `lib/hosts/presentation/host_operations`
- `lib/hosts/presentation/club_management`
- `lib/hosts/presentation/payments`

## This feature owns

- Own the /host/organizer destination, organizer selection, Edit, Insights, Preview, and settings spokes.
- Own organizer identity, type, contact data, media, publication coaching, and event defaults.
- Own team membership, ownership transfer, professional host profile, and hosted-organizer navigation.
- Own payout-account setup/status surfaces and organizer analytics query controls.
- Own account exit and organizer-level settings that do not belong to an event, audience, or communication workflow.

## This feature does not own

- Event inventory, Event Create internals, Event Manage mutations, or Today attention policy.
- Customer/audience membership, form authoring, message delivery, or shared public organizer-detail behavior.
- Provider-hosted onboarding internals, analytics computation, or backend authorization rules.

## Maintenance

Do not edit this file directly. Update `design/features/host_feature_responsibilities.json`, then run:

```sh
node tool/design/build_host_feature_responsibilities.mjs
node tool/design/build_host_feature_responsibilities.mjs --check
```

The generator cross-checks the Host shell order, typed route contract, feature-contract action owners, Dart symbols, data-contract paths, and focused tests.
