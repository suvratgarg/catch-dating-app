# Golden visual-regression harness

Deterministic golden tests are Catch's automated substitute for the light/dark +
Dynamic-Type visual QA that can't be eyeballed in CI. They guard the UI-elevation
migration (token re-skin, the 186-site sizing pass, the activity re-grade) from
**silent** visual breakage.

## Run

```bash
flutter test test/goldens                    # verify against committed baselines
flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens   # regenerate baselines (review the diff!)
```

Baselines live in `test/goldens/baseline/<name>.<light|dark>.png`.

These tests are tagged `golden`. The Ubuntu Flutter CI unit/widget step runs
with `--exclude-tags=golden` because the committed baselines are macOS-rendered
and exact PNG comparison is host-rasterizer sensitive.

## What's covered

| Golden | What it locks |
|---|---|
| `design_system_sheet` | All `CatchTokens` color roles + activity pigments, the full `CatchTextStyles` ramp (serif/sans/mono, weights, italic), and the activity-art duotone + pattern + glyph — light **and** dark. |

Add coverage as components stabilize (ticket card, polaroid, profile sections, …).

## Adding a golden

```dart
// test/goldens/my_widget_test.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'support/golden_pump.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('my widget', (tester) async {
    await matchCatchGolden(tester, 'my_widget', builder: (context) => const MyWidget());
    // Optional Dynamic-Type variant:
    // await matchCatchGolden(tester, 'my_widget@1.5', textScale: 1.5, builder: ...);
  });
}
```

`matchCatchGolden` pumps inside the real `AppTheme`, renders **light + dark**, pins
devicePixelRatio to 1.0 on a fixed surface, and re-throws real failures while
swallowing only google_fonts' offline noise (see below). Avoid `Image.network` in
goldens (it loads nothing in tests) — use activity art or inject a fake image.

## How fonts work (the tricky part)

`flutter test` stubs all HTTP to 400, so `google_fonts` can't fetch. We instead:

1. Commit the real font files in `test/goldens/fonts/` (Newsreader roman+italic
   variable, Inter variable, IBM Plex Mono Regular/Medium/SemiBold/Bold).
2. In `flutter_test_config.dart` (auto-run for this dir only — the app's other
   ~1200 tests are untouched), register them via `FontLoader` under the **exact
   variant family names google_fonts emits** (`Newsreader_800`, `Inter_600`,
   `IBMPlexMono_700`, …; w800 mono clamps to `_700`). Roman weights all map to the
   one variable file (Flutter drives the weight axis); italics map to the italic
   file; mono uses per-weight statics.
3. Disable `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching`; the resulting "not found in
   assets" notice is swallowed by the guarded zone in `golden_pump.dart`.

This is **test-only** — no fonts are added to the app bundle. If `CatchFonts`
changes the display face, re-probe the emitted family names and update the loader.

## ⚠️ Platform determinism

Golden PNGs are **platform-specific** (font rasterization differs across macOS /
Linux). The committed baselines were generated on **macOS**. Run golden tests on a
**single pinned platform** in CI; if CI is Linux, regenerate the baselines there
(`flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens`) and commit those. Treat a golden
diff as "review the change," not "auto-fail" — regenerate only when the change is
intended.

## CI

Do not run these exact PNG goldens in the default Ubuntu Flutter CI job. Run
`flutter test test/goldens` on the pinned platform alongside visual-review gates
(see `docs/release_operations.md`). A diff means a reviewer must confirm the
visual change and regenerate baselines.
