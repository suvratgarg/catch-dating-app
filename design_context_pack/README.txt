Catch design context pack

Upload surface for Claude Design and other AI design tools. This pack is generated
from the live Flutter design system; do not edit generated files by hand.

Use the design_system files to establish or refresh the organization-level design
system. Use design_system/components.json as the allowed Catch primitive
contract list for handoffs. For the live Badge + Field synchronization spike,
use design_system/claude_design_handoff_request.json and return exactly its
machine-checkable receipt contract. Use gallery shots as per-screen taste
anchors during a redesign chat.
