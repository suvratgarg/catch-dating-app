# App Listing Screenshot Production Brief

This document is the approved production handoff for the Catch consumer and
Catch Host store-listing screenshot sets. It owns the ordered story, capture
states, fixture requirements, composition rules, export matrix, and review
criteria. The app UI and deterministic capture catalog remain the source of
truth for what the product actually does.

This brief does not approve an App Store or Play submission. Release-build
parity, legal metadata, privacy answers, account state, and final upload remain
owned by [`../release_operations.md`](../release_operations.md).

Store-format references verified on 2026-07-23:

- Apple screenshot upload and count requirements:
  https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/upload-app-previews-and-screenshots/
- Apple device screenshot dimensions:
  https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/screenshot-specifications/
- Google Play preview assets, screenshot rules, and feature-graphic dimensions:
  https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151?hl=en

Recheck these sources immediately before export because store specifications
and supported device classes can change independently of this repository.

## Approved Direction

- Produce eight unique screenshot concepts for Catch and eight for Catch Host.
- Make the first three images in each set tell the whole conversion story.
- Use static screenshots for the first release. Do not produce an App Preview
  or Play preview video until the screenshot baseline is live and measured.
- Lead Catch with real events and disclose the attendance-gated matching layer.
- Lead Catch Host with event operations and the live host console, not profile
  or account setup.
- Use only real production UI rendered with coherent synthetic demo data.
- Keep both apps visibly related through one editorial design system, while
  giving Catch a social/editorial emphasis and Catch Host an operational one.

## Output Contract

| Surface | Per app | Required output | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Apple iPhone | 8 | 1320x2868 portrait PNG or JPEG, no alpha | Use a supported 6.9-inch size. App Store Connect may scale this set for smaller iPhones. |
| Apple iPad | 8 | 2064x2752 or 2048x2732 portrait PNG or JPEG, no alpha | Both iOS targets currently include iPad in `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY`; capture native adaptive layouts rather than enlarging the phone composition. |
| Google Play phone | 8 | 1080x1920 portrait 24-bit PNG or JPEG, no alpha | This fills the phone limit and satisfies the four-image, 1080px recommendation threshold. |
| Google Play feature graphic | 1 | 1024x500 24-bit PNG or JPEG, no alpha | One graphic per app. Keep the focal point centered and do not use a device silhouette. |
| Google Play tablets | Deferred gate | At least 4 per enabled tablet size class | Confirm Android tablet distribution and adaptive QA before adding tablet listing media. |

The creative system therefore contains 16 unique stories and, for the initial
Apple and phone-Play launch, 48 screenshot exports plus two Play feature
graphics. Localization creates additional exports and is a follow-up workstream
after the English (U.S.) baseline is approved.

## Copy And Composition Rules

### Copy

- Use one headline and, only when needed, one supporting sentence.
- Keep headlines to about seven words. A line break may clarify rhythm but must
  not split a phrase awkwardly.
- Use sentence case. Do not use all-caps marketing copy, superlatives, rankings,
  testimonials, prices, time-limited offers, or download/install calls to action.
- Use **Catch** as the consumer action noun and **Playbook** as the public Host
  label. Do not expose the internal **Event Success** name in listing copy.
- Do not claim identity verification. Attendance-gated matching may be described
  as involving people who checked in or attended the same event.
- Claims about reviews must say **verified guest reviews** only when the fixture
  visibly represents reviews tied to completed attendance.

### Layout

- Every image must make sense on its own; do not rely on a panorama spanning
  adjacent screenshots.
- Keep the app UI as the dominant visual. Added copy should occupy no more than
  roughly the top 20 percent of Google Play images.
- Use a single clear UI focal point. Crop or scroll to the state that proves the
  headline instead of showing a generic top-of-page state.
- Apple compositions may use the established dark editorial header, warm paper
  canvas, activity accent, and one restrained device frame.
- Google Play compositions should remove the heavy device silhouette and give
  more area to the UI. Preserve the headline, palette, and focal state.
- iPad compositions must use native tablet captures and a tablet-aware crop.
  Do not place a phone screenshot inside an iPad-shaped frame.
- Do not include notification content, carrier names, debug banners, fixture
  labels inside the app UI, or any store badge.

### Demo data

- Use deterministic synthetic people, organizers, events, messages, payments,
  reviews, and metrics. Never use a production account or real conversation.
- Keep city, currency, venue, date, event type, host, and attendee identities
  coherent across all eight images in a set.
- Use one primary consumer story and one primary Host story so the screenshots
  feel like a connected journey rather than unrelated fixtures.
- Dates must be stable relative to the injected capture clock. Avoid copy such
  as `today` or `this weekend` unless it is correct in the rendered fixture.
- Counts must remain mathematically possible: attended cannot exceed booked;
  matches cannot exceed the mutual-interest population; chat starts cannot
  exceed matches; and review counts cannot exceed eligible attendees.
- Currency must be consistent within a listing set. The English launch set uses
  the India sales-demo story and INR.

## Catch Consumer Shot Matrix

The conversion sequence is: understand the proposition, see a real event,
understand the attendance-gated difference, establish trust, see the live
experience, receive the reward, see the conversation quality, and close on
control.

| Fixture requirements | Complete viewer profile; stable preference values; no real blocked-user identity. |
| Composition | Crop around the safety/control section rather than generic profile settings. |
| Proof | The final frame closes the story on agency without using fear-based copy. |

## Catch Host Shot Matrix

The conversion sequence is: run the night, publish the event, control demand,
track money, move the door, improve the room, communicate with guests, and
measure the result.

### H01 - Live operating console

| Field | Production decision |
| --- | --- |
| Headline | **Run the whole night from one screen** |
| Support | Check in guests, move the waitlist, and stay on the run of show. |

| Proof | A host can see that Catch replaces several live-event tools with one console. |

### H02 - Guided publishing

| Field | Production decision |

| Source capture | `host_create_policy` |
| Source status | Active marketing capture; refresh and retain. |
| Required state | Completed policy step with capacity, INR price, balanced admission, demand pricing, age range, and waitlist behavior. |
| Fixture requirements | No validation errors; policy must be compatible with the event type and capacity used in H01. |
| Composition | Favor the admission format and one differentiated control. Avoid cropping field labels or sticky actions. |
| Proof | The host can see meaningful controls rather than a generic ticket form. |

### H04 - Payment readiness

| Headline | **Know where every payment stands** |
| Support | Keep payout readiness and guest payment status together. |
| Route | `hostClubsScreen` / `/host/organizers/payments` |

| Fixture requirements | Same counts as H01; no mutation pending or error state. |
| Composition | Focus lower than H01 so the guest rows and check-in actions are the hero. |
| Proof | H05 must feel distinct from H01: H01 sells command, H05 sells door execution. |

### H06 - The Playbook

| Field | Production decision |
| --- | --- |
| Headline | **Let the Playbook work the room** |
| Support | Run prompts, pods, rotations, and private introductions. |

| Composition | Keep the event selector/context and at least three useful rows. Do not use an empty thread. |
| Proof | The Host app visibly owns pre-event and booked-guest communication. |

### H08 - Organizer outcomes

| Field | Production decision |

| Headline | **See what your events created** |
| Support | Review attendance, catches, matches, chats, reviews, and payouts. |
| Route | `hostClubsScreen` / `/host/organizers` Insights tab |
| Source capture | Promote `host_clubs_insights_report`; retain `host_post_event_report` for event-level reporting evidence. |

| Required state | Populated organizer analytics with attendance, connection funnel, guest reviews, and a multi-event or event-level outcome summary. |
| Fixture requirements | Metrics must agree with the H01 roster and remain mathematically possible; no invented growth claims or percentages outside fixture data. |
| Composition | Show the connection funnel and review proof. Do not make a revenue total the primary visual. |
| Proof | The final frame shows why a host should run the next event on Catch. |

## Google Play Feature Graphics

The feature graphics are separate compositions, not collages of all eight
screenshots.

### Catch

- Message: **The event before the match.**
- Visual: one editorial event ticket or event-feed crop transitioning into one
  restrained mutual-match cue.
- Avoid profile-card grids that make the product look like a conventional
  swipe-first dating app.

### Catch Host

- Message: **Run the night. See what it created.**
- Visual: the live console as the central product surface, with restrained
  roster and report fragments as supporting layers.
- Avoid device silhouettes, account-setup UI, and performance numbers.

## Production Workflow

1. **Fixture lock**
   - Choose the shared India consumer and Host stories.
   - Add or extend fixture keys for the 10 concepts that are not already active
     marketing captures.
   - Validate all counts, dates, currencies, review eligibility, and relational
     identities.

2. **Raw capture lock**
   - Capture every selected route state without store chrome.
   - Add store-specific scroll positions only when the existing route capture
     does not place the proving UI above the fold.
   - Review phone and iPad layouts before composition begins.

3. **Composition prototype**
   - Produce C01-C03 and H01-H03 first.
   - Review the two first-three sequences at store-thumbnail size.
   - Lock headline scale, top copy region, UI crop, background, accent policy,
     and Google no-heavy-device-shell variant before composing the remaining 10.

4. **Full export**
   - Compose all 16 English concepts.
   - Export iPhone, iPad, and Play phone variants plus both feature graphics.
   - Strip alpha and validate dimensions, file type, orientation, and naming.

5. **Release-build parity**
   - Compare the raw capture source with the submitted TestFlight/internal-test
     build for every route.
   - Re-capture any state whose copy, component structure, navigation chrome, or
     visible capability differs.

6. **Upload and baseline**
   - Upload in the order defined here.
   - Record the exact asset hashes and store ordering in the role-specific asset
     manifests.
   - Establish the initial listing-conversion baseline before testing changes to
     the first three images.

## Naming Contract

Use stable, role-first names:

```text
catch-consumer-01-events-before-matches-iphone-6_9.png
catch-consumer-01-events-before-matches-ipad-13.png
catch-consumer-01-events-before-matches-play-phone.png
catch-host-01-live-console-iphone-6_9.png
catch-host-01-live-console-ipad-13.png
catch-host-01-live-console-play-phone.png
catch-consumer-play-feature-graphic.png
catch-host-play-feature-graphic.png
```

The sequence number is the upload order. A content revision retains the stable
concept id and updates the asset hash rather than inventing a new slot name.

## Acceptance Checklist

### Narrative

- [ ] C01-C03 independently explain events first, attendance-gated Catching, and
      the path to a match.
- [ ] H01-H03 independently explain live operations, guided publishing, and
      admission control.
- [ ] Every later frame adds a new reason to install; no two adjacent images
      repeat the same claim or crop.

### Product truth

- [ ] Every headline is visibly supported by the selected in-app state.
- [ ] Every person, event, organizer, review, message, payment, and metric is
      synthetic and internally coherent.
- [ ] No internal Event Success label, development banner, placeholder, loading
      state, failure state, or unsupported product claim appears.
- [ ] Screens match the release candidate for the relevant app role.

### Visual quality

- [ ] Headlines remain legible at store-thumbnail size.
- [ ] UI, sticky actions, status bars, device frames, and corner radii are not
      clipped or stretched.
- [ ] Apple, Play, and iPad variants preserve the same message while using the
      correct native layout and crop.
- [ ] C01-C08 and H01-H08 feel like two related but audience-specific campaigns.

### Technical delivery

- [ ] Eight ordered images exist for each app and required device surface.
- [ ] Apple and Play images contain no alpha channel.
- [ ] All pixel dimensions, aspect ratios, formats, and file sizes pass the
      current store checks.
- [ ] Play screenshots and feature graphics have concise alt text.
- [ ] Role-specific asset manifests contain final paths, hashes, dimensions,
      source capture ids, fixture keys, and upload order.
- [ ] The marketing capture and store-export checks pass before handoff.

## Current Asset Disposition

The three existing consumer marketing captures remain approved source seeds:
`member_event_discovery`, `post_run_catch_window`, and `match_chat_context`.

The existing five-image Catch Host App Store pack is a draft input, not a final
upload set:

- retain and refresh the admission, live-console, and reporting sources;
- replace the profile-setup opener and guest-directions image in the ordered
  listing;
- promote the live console to H01;
- extend the set from five to eight;
- revise the report crop to show outcomes rather than only roster rows; and
- remove the alpha channel from every final Apple export.
