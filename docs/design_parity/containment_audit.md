# Containment Audit — every border earns its rule

Doctrine: `docs/design_language.md` §7.1 (R1 collection object · R2
actionable module · R3 plane change · R4 status tone · R5 list frame;
depth ≤ 1; chips/skeletons/stage-paper-celebration exempt). This audit
classifies every bordered/filled surface in feature presentation code
(236 widgets inventoried 2026-07-05) and turns the failures into flatten
work items.

Workflow for Codex: same as the parity specs (verify claims with `rg`
before changing; per-item commits; focused tests + analyzer; widgetbook;
catalog/doc_versions/passes stamps; readiness gate). Every flatten item
lists its skeleton mimics — skeletons always follow their subject.
Lab/manual-QA screens (`event_policy_lab`, `event_success_lab`,
`manual_qa`) are review harnesses: SKIPPED, not audited.

  create/edit-club scaffolds' section frames.
- **Exempt classes:** every `*Pill`/`*Chip`/`*Badge`/`*Seal`/`*Dot`/marker
  (data-chip anatomy), every `*Skeleton` (follows subject), the entire
  stage/paper/live-reveal/celebration grammar (S5 calibration), HeroTime/
  HeroActivity chips, PhotoCaption, MonthMarker.

Depth check: no depth-2 bordered nesting found outside plane changes after
the contained-flush work — record any encountered during execution.

## FLATTEN work items

### N1. Reviews become divided rows `[codex]` — the headline

`ReviewCard` + `ReviewOwnerResponseBlock` (reviews_section.dart:293, :371)
render card-per-review. DS ReviewRow contract: rows inside ONE hairline
container (R5), divider on every row after the first, inline list capped at
2–3, closed with a quiet mono "ALL N REVIEWS →" row. Apply exactly that:
one `CatchSurface(borderColor: t.line)` list frame per reviews block,
`CatchDivider.fieldRow`-separated review rows, owner responses as indented
flat blocks inside their row (hairline-left or spacing — no nested border;
depth ≤ 1). Surfaces affected: club detail, event social section, reviews
history (history may keep uncapped list; the cap applies to inline
previews). `ReviewHistoryItemSkeleton` follows. Stars stay ink (already
aligned).

### N2. Filters screen adopts the flat form grammar `[codex]`

`FiltersSection` (swipes/filters_screen.dart) boxes its filter groups.
Migrate to the settings/profile-edit grammar: `CatchSection.fieldRows` +
flush rows + hairline dividers. Coordinate with the screen's outstanding
gutter-scanner HIGH findings (same file) — fix both in one pass.

### N3. Calendar stats header flattens to a metric strip `[codex]`

`CalendarStatsHeader` (+ its skeleton) boxes summary stats. Replace the
bordered surface with the flat `CatchMetricStrip` treatment club detail
uses. Values/labels unchanged; skeleton follows.

### N4. Analytics info panels lose their boxes `[confirm]`

`UserAnalyticsTrendPanel`, `UserAnalyticsTipsPanel`,
`HostAnalyticsTrendPanel`, `HostAnalyticsReviewDiscoveryPanel`, and
`HostAnalyticsEventList`'s empty-state surface: charts, tips, and stat
pairs are information inside kicker sections — the border is an information
box. Flatten: section kicker + flat content (chart bars, stat columns, tip
rows with dividers where stacked = R5). The metric-tile GRIDS keep their
borders (R1 peers). Visible change on both analytics surfaces — owner
confirm before execution.

### N5. Informational empty/locked states go inline `[codex]`

`UserAnalyticsEmptyState`, `EmptyRosterMessage`, and the Catches-hub
explainer surface (`CatchesHubEmptyState`'s bordered how-it-works card):
informational, not actionable — render flat (icon + title + supporting,
CatchEmptyState inline layout, no border). `GuestWhoIsGoing`: verify tone —
if its fill is neutral it flattens the same way; if it deliberately reads
as a locked/status treatment, re-tone it as an explicit R4 surface and
record which.

### N6. Host event summary card becomes a list frame `[codex]`

`HostEventSummaryCard` (host_event_manage_screen.dart) boxes a stack of
icon/label/value rows — that is an R5 list frame at most: one hairline
container + divided rows, or fully flat rows inside its parent section if
the section already provides the frame. Pick whichever the surrounding
composition already uses; no card.

### N7. Event-detail info sections — verify against the DS template `[codex]`

`WhatToExpectSection` and `EventDetailPolicySummary` were recently moved
INTO contained cards (section-header pass); under the doctrine they are
information and would flatten — but the event-detail template is the
DS-blessed slice, so check `templates/catch-event-detail` + the
`HintList`/`MechanismList`/`Itinerary` component contracts in
`~/Downloads/Catch Design System (2)/` first. Where the template renders
these flat/hairline, flatten to divided sections; where it genuinely boxes
them, record the rule the box earns. Same check covers
`EventDetailHintList` and `ItineraryRow`.

### N8. Form-step surface batch — box only the modules `[codex]`

`HostProfileForm`, `EventPolicyStep` (six surfaces), `EventSuccessStep`,
`ClubHostDefaultsStep`/`_PolicyDefaultsCard`, `EventSuccessDefaultsPanel`,
`IntegrationNotesCard`, `ChatEventContextHeader`: per surface, apply the
test — input/editor modules and pickers keep their box (R2); pure grouping
or explainer text flattens to `CatchSection`/fieldRows grammar. Record the
verdict per surface in the receipt; expected outcome is most of the six
EventPolicyStep boxes collapse into one section with divided rows.

## Enforcement (after the burn-down)

Once N1–N8 land: add a `design:containment` inventory scanner — every
`CatchSurface` with a visible border/fill in presentation code must carry a
`// containment: R<n>` marker comment or appear in this audit's KEEP list;
new unmarked surfaces are MEDIUM findings. Inventory-first, ratchet later,
per the enforcement doctrine. Scanner work is manifest + `.mjs` only.
