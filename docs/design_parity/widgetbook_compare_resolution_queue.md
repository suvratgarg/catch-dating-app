# Widgetbook Compare Resolution Queue

Generated from live review notes saved through
`tool/design/widgetbook_compare_server.mjs`.

## Implementation Batches

1. Completed: field system consolidation. `CatchField` is the canonical
   information atom; old field/text/info adapters and API aliases are removed.
2. Completed: Widgetbook duplicate consolidation for primitives that already
   have formal contracts. Keep contract previews as the canonical review
   surface and remove smaller catalog-only duplicates.
3. Completed: metric system consolidation. `CatchMetricStrip` is the canonical
   metric rail; the old stat-strip primitive and standalone Widgetbook page are
   removed.
4. Completed: top-bar system consolidation. `CatchTopBar.identity` owns
   conversation title/avatar composition under the `catch.top_bar` contract.
   Chat screens use it directly; no chat-specific top-bar wrapper remains.
5. Completed: surface system consolidation. `CatchSurface` owns base cards,
   tinted notes, inline messages, and tappable low-level surface chrome;
   redundant surface wrapper classes and standalone Widgetbook pages are
   removed.
6. Completed: top-bar and hero boundary. `CatchTopBar` remains app-bar chrome;
   club/event hero app bars remain separate hero concepts with naming cleanup
   tracked separately.
7. Completed: section system consolidation. `CatchSection` is the canonical
   information-grouping primitive with divided, contained, and plain variants;
   the former field-group, design-section, and section-surface APIs are
   removed.
8. Completed: owner-approved badge/status, compact-control, identity-switcher,
   and progress-cue families. Stable decisions and implemented dispositions
   live in `widget_consolidation/pattern_families.json` and `decisions.json`;
   the standalone wall renders the canonical production outcomes side by side.
   No approved family remains in the default implementation queue. Generated
   similarity pairs and clusters remain discovery evidence only.

## Pattern Family Queue

| Family | Status | Quality direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chip-core` | implemented | One `CatchChip` contract owns quiet tags, selectable choices, removable tags, and typed activity chips. Hidden from the default queue unless `Show resolved` is enabled. |
| `badge-status` | implemented | `CatchBadge` owns named visual recipes, `CatchCountBadge` owns typed integers, `CatchStatusDot` owns marks, and `CatchInlineStatus` owns quiet unboxed state. |
| `floating-compact-controls` | implemented | Icon-only and labelled actions keep distinct APIs while sharing 44px defaults, the 40px app-bar exception, and typed count rendering. |
| `identity-switchers` | implemented | The club switcher is whole-surface interactive for multiple clubs, passive for one, and exposes real art plus selected/role context. |
| `progress-cues` | implemented | Ordered compact rails and expanded rows share future/current/complete state semantics while retaining distinct layouts. |

Event Detail was not included in this approval and remains excluded while its
screen redesign is active in a parallel worktree.

## Focused Visual Decision Queue

Status: four pattern families implemented and visually verified

The first screen of the compare tool is the stable pattern-family queue. Each
member receives one of `canonical`, `repair`, `unify`, `register`, or `discard`.
Similarity evidence remains available in a separate bucket for discovery and
boundary checks.

The stable owner-question ids (`B1`–`B5`, `C1`–`C4`, `I1`–`I3`, `P1`–`P3`)
now have implemented outcomes in the pattern-family and mechanical decision
registries. The broader candidates below remain unresolved and were not
covered by that approval or implementation tranche.

| Candidate | Review question | Compare id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom chrome boundary | Are sticky CTA footers and reusable bottom docks separate primitives, or variants of one bottom-chrome primitive? | `decision-preview-bottom-chrome` |
| Event visual/card/media boundary | Which event card/media/hero primitives are canonical, and which are variants of a smaller event visual system? | `decision-preview-event-visual-system` |
| Person row boundary | Is `CatchPersonRow` the canonical people-row primitive, and how should it relate to avatar/list-tile composition? | `decision-preview-person-row-boundary` |
| Chat header private pieces | Should `_ChatsHeaderChrome` and `_ChatsHeaderTitle` become public chat-header primitives, or merge into top-bar/browse-header modes? | `decision-preview-chat-header-boundary` |

Resolved within the event visual review: `CatchViewportCurveFrame` is not a
global event/media primitive. Its viewport clipping behavior is owned by the
club hero/header implementation.

## Second Pass Candidate Backlog

Status: pending future owner review; no implementation order approved

These are broader Widgetbook catalog boundaries that still look like possible
drift points after the field, surface, top-bar, metric, and section
consolidation passes.

| Candidate | Review question | Initial direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DetailRow vs Field | Is compact label/value metadata a density mode of `CatchField`, or a separate table-row primitive? | Review before migrating dense payment/detail sheets. |
| BrowseHeader vs feature browse headers | Are Explore/Chats header wrappers meaningful route adapters or duplicated header primitives? | Keep wrappers only when they own route/provider state; move chrome into `CatchBrowseHeader`. |
| ActionMenu vs Menu | Is action-menu trigger behavior a `CatchMenu` mode? | Keep one menu panel grammar; decide whether the trigger convenience deserves its own contract. |
| SectionLabel vs Kicker | Are these one mono eyebrow primitive with icon/accent variants? | Likely merge if `CatchKicker` can absorb icon/accent behavior. |
| SectionHeader vs Section | Is `CatchSectionHeader` only for list/rail headers, or should titled section chrome belong entirely to `CatchSection`? | Keep separate only for rail/list headers. |
| EmptyState vs feature empty states | Which feature empty wrappers add semantic copy/actions, and which are just pass-through wrappers? | Keep semantic wrappers; inline no-op wrappers into `CatchEmptyState`. |
| SelectChip vs OptionCard | Are chip/card choices variants of one option primitive? | Review with `SegmentedControl vs OptionGroup` as one selection-system pass. |

## Field System

Status: implemented

Production migration status:

- `CatchField` production/test call sites use the canonical primitive directly.
- The former settings-row, select-menu, and dropdown-field public primitives
  have been removed; their behavior is represented by `CatchField` value-lane
  and select modes.
- Legacy field/info source files have been deleted rather than retained as
  adapters.
- `CatchField` exposes `title`, `body`, `valueText`, `action`, and
  `placeholder`; the old `label`, `value`, `trailing`, and `hintText` aliases
  are not part of the public field API.
- Section/group wrapping has moved to `CatchSection`.

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field vs FieldRow | merge | `CatchField` is the canonical row primitive. `CatchField` should not remain a separate design concept. |
| Field vs TextField | merge | Text input is a `CatchField` mode/state. Visual differences should come from the surrounding section/group wrapper, not from a separate primitive identity. |
| Field grouping vs section grouping | merge | Field grouping is a `CatchSection` variant, not a separate primitive. |
| SettingsRow vs Field | merge | Settings rows are `CatchField` rows with `valueText`, action, navigation, divider, and danger tone configuration. |
| SelectMenu vs DropdownField | merge | Menu-backed selection is `CatchField.select`; form validation and value syncing live in the field primitive. |

Implementation target:

- Keep one global field primitive with optional icon, title, body text, and
  action/control slots.
- Preserve edit, read, navigation, toggle, add, validation, helper,
  clearable-input, value-lane, select, and expanded-control states as field
  modes.
- Treat section/group wrapping as `CatchSection` composition around the field
  primitive.
- Keep Widgetbook contract states as the canonical field review surface.

## Search System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SearchField vs ExpandingSearch | merge | `CatchSearchField` owns both always-expanded field mode and animated app-bar expansion mode; `CatchSearchField` expanding mode is removed. |

Implementation target:

- Keep search input and expansion/clear/close behavior on `CatchSearchField`.
- Use `CatchSearchFieldMode.expanding` for header/app-bar search affordances and
  the default field mode for always-expanded search.

## Avatar System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ActivityAvatar vs PersonAvatar | merge | Activity-context initials and dim states are `CatchPersonAvatar` variants, not a separate avatar primitive. |
| PersonAvatar vs PersonAvatarStack | separate concepts | `CatchPersonAvatarStack` remains a composition primitive and composes `CatchPersonAvatar` rather than reimplementing it. |

## Selection System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SegmentedControl vs OptionGroup | separate concepts | Keep segmented controls and option groups separate for now; both still need a later refinement pass. |

## Bottom Chrome System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BottomCta vs BottomDock | separate concepts | Sticky CTA footers and utility docks remain separate primitives. |

## Top Bar System

Status: implemented

Production migration status:

- `CatchTopBar.identity` owns the conversation/profile-backed title row with
  avatar, name, optional identity tap, top-bar surface, and shared action slots.
- Chat screens build their typed `shareCard`, `report`, and `block` action menu
  directly through `CatchTopBarMenuAction`.
- The standalone chat top-bar Widgetbook primitive page has been removed; the
  `conversation-title` state now lives under the canonical `catch.top_bar`
  contract preview.
- Missing profile navigation is runtime availability, not a separate top-bar
  design variant.

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TopBar vs conversation title/header | merge | Conversation avatar/name chrome is a `CatchTopBar.identity` state, not a separate primitive or wrapper. |

Implementation target:

- Keep conversation/header composition on `CatchTopBar.identity`; do not add a
  renamed top-bar helper or compatibility wrapper.
- Keep chat-specific action values (`shareCard`, `report`, `block`) outside the primitive contract; the primitive should expose a general menu/action slot.
- Remove “profile navigation disabled” as a design variant. A missing `onProfileTap` callback is runtime availability, not a separate component state.
- Update Widgetbook so the chat top-bar preview is cataloged under the canonical top-bar contract or clearly marked as a product composition using `CatchTopBar`.

Resolved implementation questions:

- Chat action enum and disabled-action policy remain in chat state, not in a
  widget wrapper.
- The conversation title/avatar slot belongs directly on `CatchTopBar.identity`
  so the canonical primitive owns the layout, typography, hit target, and
  overflow behavior.

## Host Roster System

Status: implemented in Widgetbook

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CatchRosterTable: catalog vs contract | merge | `catch.roster_table` is already the canonical primitive. Catalog and contract previews should converge instead of remaining duplicate listings. |
| CatchRosterTiles: catalog vs contract | merge | `catch.roster_tiles` is already the canonical primitive. Catalog and contract previews should converge instead of remaining duplicate listings. |
| CatchRosterRow: catalog vs contract | merge | `catch.roster_row` is already the canonical primitive. Catalog and contract previews should converge instead of remaining duplicate listings. |

Implementation target:

- Keep `CatchRosterTable` in `lib/hosts/presentation/widgets/catch_roster_board.dart` as the global host-operations primitive.
- Preserve the richer contract states: populated, empty, partial-columns, and long-copy.
- Keep `catch.roster_tiles`, `catch.roster_row`, and `catch.roster_table`
  contract previews as the canonical review surfaces.
- Remove the smaller catalog-only roster listings so Widgetbook has one review
  surface per roster primitive.

## Status Badge System

Status: implemented in Widgetbook

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CatchPrivacyBadge: catalog vs contract | merge | `catch.privacy_badge` is already the canonical primitive. Catalog and contract previews should converge instead of remaining duplicate listings. |

Implementation target:

- Keep `CatchPrivacyBadge` as the global privacy/status primitive.
- Preserve the contract states: private-to-you, catch-private, and host-can-see.
- Remove or redirect the catalog-only privacy badge listing so Widgetbook has one canonical review surface.

## Sequence System

Status: implemented in Widgetbook

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CatchJourneySteps: catalog vs contract | merge | `catch.journey_steps` is already the canonical primitive. Catalog and contract previews should converge instead of remaining duplicate listings. |

Implementation target:

- Keep `CatchJourneySteps` as the global ordered-sequence primitive.
- Preserve the richer contract states, including default, compact, accent, and long-copy coverage.
- Remove or redirect the catalog-only journey steps listing so Widgetbook has one canonical review surface.

## Metric System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metric rail consolidation | merge | Use `CatchMetricStrip` as the canonical visual style. The old stat rail primitive is removed rather than retained as an alias or adapter. |

Implementation target:

- Keep the left-side `CatchMetricStrip` styling: centered value-over-label cells, compact surface padding, hairline dividers, and optional unit text.
- Use `CatchMetricStripItem` as the only metric item model.
- Club/detail stats now use `CatchMetricStrip`; the old stat-strip source file is deleted.
- `CatchMetricStrip` is registered as formal component contract `catch.metric_strip`, and Widgetbook exposes contract states as the canonical review surface.

## Hero Naming Boundary

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TopBar vs ClubHeroAppBar | separate concepts | App bars and hero app bars are different components. Keep `CatchTopBar` for route chrome, and keep club/event hero implementations as hero concepts rather than top-bar variants. |

Implementation target:

- Keep `CatchTopBar` focused on app-bar title, identity, leading, search, and
  actions.
- Keep club and event hero app bars separate from the top-bar contract.
- Track any future cleanup as naming/registration work for hero concepts, not a
  merge into `catch.top_bar`.

## Surface System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface vs Panel | merge | Use `CatchSurface.card(...)` for bounded card surfaces. |
| Surface vs SoftBand | merge | Use `CatchSurface.tinted(...)` for quiet tinted inset surfaces. |
| Surface vs Callout | merge | Use `CatchSurface.message(...)` for inline icon/title/message notes. |
| Section card surface | merge | Use `CatchSection.contained(...)` for section-card content chrome. |

Implementation target:

- `CatchSurface` is the only low-level surface primitive.
- Preserve base `surface`, `raised`, `primary-soft`, `transparent`,
  `tappable`, and `elevated` states.
- Keep canonical `card`, `tinted`, and `message` states in the `catch.surface`
  contract and Widgetbook preview.
- Remove redundant surface wrapper classes, imports, tests, and standalone
  Widgetbook catalog pages rather than retaining adapters.

## Section System

Status: implemented

Reviewed decisions:

| Candidate | Decision | Canonical direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FieldGroup vs Section | merge | `CatchSection` owns contained rounded groups and divided hairline groups. |
| Section card surface | merge | Rounded section chrome belongs to `CatchSection.contained`, not the surface primitive. |
| CatchSectionStack: catalog vs contract | merge | Keep `CatchSectionStack` as page rhythm only and remove the catalog-only duplicate preview. |

Implementation target:

- Keep `CatchField` as the information atom.
- Keep `CatchSection` as the only information-grouping primitive with
  `divided`, `contained`, and `plain` variants.
- Keep `CatchSectionStack` for page gutter/rhythm only.
- Remove the former field-group, design-section, and section-surface references
  rather than retaining wrappers or adapters.
