# catch-marketing-website

Use when changing the public marketing website, organizer directory/listing
routes, public SEO metadata, marketing media, shared React web config, or
marketing website CI.

Read: `docs/marketing_website_architecture.md`,
`docs/web_surface_architecture.md`,
`docs/marketing_landing_page_research.md`,
`docs/marketing_app_media_pipeline.md`, `website/README.md`,
`packages/web-config/README.md`, `design/website/routes.json`, and
`design/website/components.json`.

Loop:

1. Generate a scoped context pack for the marketing website paths before
   editing.
2. Use `docs/marketing_website_architecture.md` for source layout,
   page/controller/component boundaries, and refactor order.
3. Update `design/website/routes.json` before changing public route, metadata,
   static-output, sitemap, robots, generated listing, or review-state behavior.
4. Update `design/website/components.json` before changing component ownership,
   CSS ownership, or Storybook route/section coverage.
5. Run the route and component contract checks before visual/component review:
   `node tool/run.mjs check marketing:website-routes`.
   `node tool/run.mjs check marketing:website-components`.
6. Run the shared React architecture-boundary gate before handoff:
   `node tool/run.mjs check web:react-architecture-boundaries`.
7. Run the shared React primitive gate before handoff:
   `node tool/run.mjs check web:react-ui-primitives`.
8. Run the shared React component-family gate before handoff:
   `node tool/run.mjs check web:react-component-governance`.
9. Run the marketing typecheck/build loop for behavior changes:
   `npm --workspace catch-marketing run typecheck` and
   `npm --workspace catch-marketing run build`.
9. Run `npm --workspace catch-marketing run build:storybook` when Storybook
   stories, component registry entries, or route/section composition changed.
10. Keep website source-of-truth docs, tool manifest entries, CI path filters,
   regression guards, and audit receipts current when enforcement changes.

Current route-first contract: public route ownership lives in
`design/website/routes.json`, is validated by
`tool/marketing/check_website_routes.mjs`, and is enforced in the marketing
workflow before the production build.

Current component-first contract: component ownership lives in
`design/website/components.json`, is validated by
`tool/marketing/check_website_components.mjs`, and attaches route and section
Storybook coverage to the same route ids rather than creating a second
independent website inventory. The first coverage layer is route plus sections,
not small reusable component atoms. Generated organizer listing coverage starts
with the route family and major sections; add smaller atoms only after the route
and section states have checked coverage.

Current React primitive contract: interactive controls must be routed through
shared website primitives under `website/src/shared/ui/**` or neutral site
primitives under `website/src/shared/site/**`. Feature, app, and Storybook code
must not render raw native action/form controls unless a temporary
`react-ui-primitive-allow: <debt-id>` override is present and tracked.

Current React component-family contract: governed component shells must be
routed through shared website primitives. The first enforced families are the
retired website legacy site barrel/import boundary, data
tables, form shells, admin editor section/form shells, admin layout span classes, admin eyebrow labels, admin card/stat layout shells, admin marketing studio shell/tabs, admin marketing post-board shells, admin marketing composer flow shells, admin marketing picker list/row shells, admin marketing feature-shot grid/card shells, admin marketing brand-contract shells, admin marketing help/compliance text/list shells, admin marketing event-library grid/card/link shells, admin marketing media-library grid/card shells, admin marketing new-post grid/card shells, admin marketing guide shells, admin marketing stacked-section shells, admin marketing app-media shells, admin marketing field shells, admin marketing layout shells, admin diff list shells, admin publishing utility primitives, admin event supply shells, admin selected table rows, admin marketing tag rows, admin marketing query lists, admin marketing slide editor/list shells, admin marketing recommendation list/item shells, admin marketing audit list/row shells, admin feature-drop feature editor/list shells, admin feature-drop controls/preview shells, admin marketing preview/export shells, admin marketing carousel preview shells, admin marketing image editor shells, admin guardrail lists, admin intake source lists, admin intake gate lists, admin intake decision shells, admin intake workspace shells, admin organizer intake curation shells, admin overview queue shells, admin overview analytics shells, field-layout grids, website organizer filter rails, and

Storybook stories that render query-backed website sections must wrap them in
`WebsiteQueryProvider`, matching the production React root in
`website/src/main.tsx`. Do this in the story when the global preview does not
provide the runtime wrapper.

Failure modes to avoid: route metadata drifting from postbuild output, generated
organizer URLs changing without contract review, `noindex`/canonical behavior
hydrating differently from static HTML, CI building after silently mutating
generated listings, component review beginning before public routes have an
owned contract, Storybook stories drifting from `design/website/components.json`,
query-backed route or section stories rendering outside the website Query
provider, feature code hand-rolling native interactive controls instead of
using shared primitives, or raw governed component shells such as featured
organizer card shells instead of shared component-family primitives, or
passing governed route-shell class names through generic primitives instead of
adding a named shared wrapper, or recreating/importing
`website/src/components/site.tsx` instead of importing from `shared/site`,
`shared/ui/primitives`, or a feature-owned adapter.
