# Data Contracts

This is the source of truth for Firestore document shape, Cloud Functions write
ownership, schema tooling, relationship documents, migration policy, and rules
test workflow. It replaces the separate Firestore/Functions contract tracker,
relationship-doc migration tracker, and schema-contract unification tracker.

For a human map of every backend operation, use
`docs/backend_operation_catalog.md`. For environment deploy order, use
`docs/release_operations.md`.

## Read Policy

Read this before changing:

- Firestore rules or Storage rules tied to Firestore documents;
- Cloud Functions mutation boundaries;
- Dart/TypeScript model generation;
- JSON schemas under `contracts/`;
- callable request/response validation;
- seed/demo document builders;
- relationship/action documents;
- data migration or repair tools;
- Firestore rules test execution.

## Sources Of Truth

| Surface | Owner |
|---|---|
| Persisted document schemas, callable payload schemas, fixtures, catalogs | `contracts/` |
| Storage path contracts (upload paths, content-type, size limits, owner) | `contracts/storage/` |
| Generated TypeScript interfaces, Ajv validators, and Admin SDK Timestamp types | `functions/src/shared/generated/` |
| Generated Dart schema constants/registry | `lib/core/schema_contracts/generated/` |
| Tool-side schema registry and validators | `tool/contracts/generated/` |
| Firestore operation ownership metadata | `tool/contracts/firestore_contract.json` |
| Human operation map | `docs/backend_operation_catalog.md` |
| Active backlog/rules | `docs/audit_registry/backlog.json` and `docs/audit_registry/rules.json` |

Do not hand-edit generated outputs. Change the contract source, run the schema
generator, and commit the generated diff.

### TypeScript Timestamp Projections

Functions code has two generated TS projections for Firestore documents. Both
come from JSON Schema; the boundary is the timestamp representation:

- **`functions/src/shared/generated/*.ts` — JSON Schema-derived.** Timestamps
  appear as serialized `{_seconds: number, _nanoseconds: number}` objects.
  Use for callable payload validation, fixtures, demo seed data, and any code
  that reads or writes the persisted JSON shape directly.
- **`functions/src/shared/generated/firestoreAdminTypes.ts` — Admin SDK
  projection.** Timestamps appear as `FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp` instances.
  Use when Functions code interacts with Admin SDK methods that return live
  Timestamp objects, for example `doc.data()` after a Firestore read.

`tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs` emits both projections.
`tool/contracts/check_firestore_contract.mjs` cross-checks that the Admin SDK
projection has the expected fields for every collection with a
`typescriptInterface` entry.

## Normal Workflow

```bash
node tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs
node tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs --check
node tool/contracts/validate_schema_contracts.mjs
./tool/check_data_contract.sh
```

Run Firestore and Storage rules tests through emulators unless those emulators
are already running:

```bash
firebase emulators:exec --only firestore,storage "npm --prefix functions run test:rules"
```

A direct `npm --prefix functions run test:rules` expects Firestore on
`127.0.0.1:8080` and Storage on `127.0.0.1:9199`. `ECONNREFUSED` is an emulator
workflow failure first, not proof the rules are wrong.

## Contract Architecture

JSON Schema draft-07 is the canonical persisted-shape format. Ajv validates
schemas in Functions/tooling, generated Dart constants support Flutter tests and
selected production validation, and Firestore rules remain behavioral security
checks rather than a generated JSON Schema runtime.

The contract layer owns:

- collection ids and storage paths;
- full document shapes and patch/input payloads;
- enum values and scalar limits;
- field optionality/nullability;
- prompt/catalog ids and limits;
- ownership metadata such as client-writable, callable-owned, trigger-owned,
  server-only, and read-only projection (see "Field Ownership Tags" below);
- migration metadata for path/storage renames;
- valid and invalid fixtures.

### Optional, Nullable, And Patch Fields

Default DTO, view-model, and document fields to plain nullable values when
absence and explicit `null` have the same product meaning. Use required
nullable parameters only when the caller must explicitly confirm that the field
was considered, and prefer avoiding that shape unless it materially improves the
API contract.

Use sentinel-backed parameters only for patch/copy APIs where "leave unchanged"
must be distinguishable from "clear this nullable field." Generated patch
classes use `unsetSentinel` from `lib/core/sentinels.dart` and compare it with
`identical`; callers should pass `null` only when the persisted value should be
cleared. Do not add new ad hoc sentinels outside patch/copy semantics without
first documenting the same clear-versus-omit distinction.

### Field Ownership Tags

Per-field ownership lives next to the property in the Firestore schema as
`x-catch-ownership`. Valid values: `client-writable`, `client-runtime-writable`,
`callable-owned`, `trigger-owned`, `server-only`. Properties without a tag are
unclassified — typically content fields that flow through a callable without
the callable owning their lifecycle.

```json
"hostUserId": {
  "$ref": "../shared/event_common.schema.json#/definitions/documentId",
  "x-catch-ownership": "callable-owned"
}
```

`tool/contracts/firestore_contract.json` deliberately does NOT carry
per-collection field-group arrays (`clientWritableFields`, etc.). Those are
derived from `x-catch-ownership` and validated by
`tool/contracts/check_firestore_contract.mjs`. The contract file still owns
collection-level ownership metadata (paths, rules-match strings, operations,
exported function names, migration notes).

It does not own multi-document business behavior, ranking algorithms,
notification fan-out, dynamic Auth/current-time checks, or full Firestore rules.
Those stay in Functions, repositories, rules, and domain services, consuming
generated constants/validators where useful.

### Generated Dart Callable Request DTOs

`tool/contracts/generate_schema_contracts.mjs` emits typed Dart classes for
every callable payload schema (and the `update_user_profile` patch) into
`lib/core/schema_contracts/generated/callable_request_dtos.g.dart`. Each class
has a named-parameter constructor, typed fields, and a `toJson()` that the
existing `test/core/callable_dto_contracts_test.dart` validates against the
source schema. Generated patch helpers expose `toFieldsJson()` for repository
tests and `toCallableJson()` for the actual callable payload wrapper.

Feature-level `lib/**/data/*_callable_dtos.dart` files remain only when they
own hand-written response parsers, normalization, or other behavior. Pure
re-export barrels should be deleted; callers can import generated request DTOs
directly from `callable_request_dtos.g.dart` with explicit `show` lists.
Hand-written DTO classes remain in feature files only when the JSON Schema
cannot capture the behavior — specifically:

- domain → DTO adapter factories (`CreateEventCallableRequest.fromEvent(Event)`)
  that walk a domain model and convert `DateTime` → `int millis`;
- serialization-time normalization that the generated class does not yet own
  (`EventBookingCallableRequest` and `CreateRazorpayOrderCallableRequest` trim
  `inviteCode` even though dedicated payload schemas exist);
- serialization-time shape transforms (e.g.
  `PlacesAutocompleteCallableRequest` flattens a `LocationCoordinate? bias`
  into top-level `latitude`/`longitude`);
- response decoders (`*CallableResponse` with `fromCallableData` factories)
  and feature-local exceptions.

See backlog item `CONTRACT-DART-GEN-001` for the path to migrating the
remaining cases (custom normalization, generated adapters, and response
decoders).

## Relationship Documents

Root-level edge/action documents are the source of truth for many-to-many state:

| Relationship | Source document |
|---|---|
| Club membership | `clubMemberships/{clubId_uid}` |
| One hosted-club lock | `clubHostClaims/{uid}` |
| Event booking, waitlist, attendance, cancellation | `eventParticipations/{eventId_uid}` |
| Saved events | `savedEvents/{uid_eventId}` |
| Outgoing profile decisions | `profileDecisions/{uid}/outgoing/{targetId}` |
| Match messages | `matches/{matchId}/messages/{messageId}` |
| Notification timeline | `notifications/{uid}/items/{notificationId}` |
| Club follower posts | `clubs/{clubId}/posts/{postId}` |

Retired relationship arrays must not be reintroduced into Flutter models,
Functions writes, Firestore rules, active tooling, or tests. Parent entity docs
keep only aggregate projections such as `memberCount`, `bookedCount`,
`waitlistedCount`, `checkedInCount`, `genderCounts`, `rating`, `reviewCount`,
and `nextEventAt`.

Direct client writes are still allowed only for narrow owner-owned actions that
rules can prove locally: onboarding drafts, saved events, outgoing profile decisions,
match-scoped chat messages, own unread reset, own notification `readAt`, and
own FCM token. Multi-document product writes belong in callables or triggers.

Each device push token lives at
`users/{uid}/pushInstallations/{installationId}` with `token`, `appRole`,
`environment`, `platform`, optional app version/build, `locale`, `timeZone`, and
`updatedAt`. The client owns this device metadata and rules restrict writes to
the authenticated user plus the known role/environment/platform vocabulary.
Notification producers select reviewed templates by stable message id and use
the installation locale when the delivery path supports per-installation
fan-out. English remains the bundled server fallback; notification prose must
not be stored as an unversioned remote document.

## Club Follower Posts

Organizer follower posts live under `clubs/{clubId}/posts/{postId}` and are
created only by the `createClubPost` callable. Clients may read authenticated
posts, but direct writes are denied. The callable verifies host authority,
validates optional linked events against the same club, enforces the rolling
three-posts-per-seven-days club quota, writes the canonical post, and fans out
durable `clubUpdate` activity notifications to active followers.

## Event Broadcast Receipts

Host event broadcasts use the operational receipt
`eventBroadcasts/{broadcastId}`. Only `sendEventBroadcast` creates or advances
the receipt; account-deletion cleanup may delete a host-authored receipt or
remove one recipient's identifiers and delivery evidence. Direct client reads
and writes are denied. The Host client receives only the sanitized callable
response counts.

The callable verifies current event-host authority and freezes a server-resolved
audience from `eventParticipations`. Booked means `signedUp` plus `attended`;
prospective means `waitlisted`. Inquiry threads are never an audience source,
and the broadcast never creates a match, conversation, or chat message.

Each eligible recipient gets a deterministic `eventUpdated` Activity item.
Push is preference-gated and attempted at most once: durable Activity creation
is the retry boundary, so an uncertain retry reports an unknown push outcome
instead of sending a duplicate. The receipt stores hashed per-recipient
evidence for repair and aggregate delivery counts, remains server-only, and
requires the `eventBroadcasts.expiresAt` Firestore TTL policy for 90-day
retention.

## Organizer Claim Documents

Public organizer claims use a dedicated review collection instead of overloading
host locks:

| Collection / field | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `clubClaimRequests/{requestId}` | `requestClubClaim`, `adminDecideClubClaim` | Server-owned claim queue. Clients create and decide only through callables; direct Firestore reads/writes are denied. |
| `clubs/{clubId}.claim` | claim callables and admin index-review callables | Public-page claim state, latest request id, review audit, and owner-facing status. |
| `clubs/{clubId}.ownership` | claim callables, create/update club callables | `programmatic` before ownership, `claimed` after approval. |
| `clubs/{clubId}.publicPage.indexReview` | `adminSetClubIndexStatus` | Audit evidence for source quality, media rights, cadence, and owner/contact verification before a page becomes indexable. |
| `reviews/{reviewId}.ownerResponse` | `setReviewResponse` | Server-owned owner response rendered by app and website review surfaces. |

`clubHostClaims/{uid}` remains the one-hosted-club lock. It is not the public
claim request queue.

## Event Discovery Projection

Explore queries `events` directly through callable-owned projection fields
instead of resolving a city to clubs first. The projection currently covers
city, activity kind, coarse geo-cell, availability bucket, gate flags, and age
range:

- `discoveryCityName`, `discoveryActivityKind`, `discoveryGeoCell`;
- `discoveryHasOpenSpots`, `discoveryAvailability`;
- `discoveryOpenCohorts`, `discoveryWaitlistCohorts`;
- `discoveryInviteRequired`, `discoveryMembershipRequired`,
  `discoveryManualApprovalRequired`;
- `discoveryMinAge`, `discoveryMaxAge`.

`functions/src/events/eventDiscoveryProjection.ts` owns the write-time
projection. Event create/update/cancel, paid signup, and signup cancellation
must refresh these fields whenever event capacity, policy, status, activity, or
location inputs change. `discoveryOpenCohorts` gives Firestore a coarse
viewer-cohort open-slot filter for the standard event-policy cohorts; gated
events still require viewer-specific post-query resolution for invite,
membership, and manual-approval state. `firestore.indexes.json` owns the
supporting composite indexes for city, time, activity, geo-cell, coarse
availability, and open-cohort filters.

Existing remote event docs created before this projection must be repaired with
`node tool/data/backfill_event_discovery_fields.mjs` before a release depends on
the direct event index. The repair is dry-run by default and requires
`--allow-prod` when applying against prod.

Admin organizer search uses a separate server-owned
`clubs/{clubId}.adminSearch` projection for the admin Organizers canonical
directory. It is not consumed by the app or website. `adminListClubDetails`
accepts either a single `citySlug` or a bounded `citySlugs` array for
admin-only launch-city work queues such as Indore + Mumbai. Existing club docs
can be repaired with `node tool/data/backfill_organizer_admin_search.mjs`; the
repair is dry-run by default and requires `--allow-prod` when applying against
prod.

Admin event search uses a separate server-owned
`events/{eventId}.adminSearch` projection for the admin Events canonical
directory. It is not consumed by the app. `adminListEventDetails` accepts either
a single `citySlug` or a bounded `citySlugs` array for admin-only launch-city
work queues such as Indore + Mumbai. Existing event docs can be repaired with
`node tool/data/backfill_event_admin_search.mjs`; the repair is dry-run by
default and requires `--allow-prod` when applying against prod.

Read-only external event supply uses `externalEvents/{eventId}`. These records
are sourced from reviewed organizer intake candidates, preserve source/dedupe
attribution, and must keep Catch booking, payments, reservations, and waitlists
disabled. `adminListExternalEventDetails` lists that collection for admin event
supply review with the same bounded launch-city and time-window filters, but it
does not import candidates or mutate Firestore.

Read-only dry-runs on 2026-05-26 found:

| Environment | Events scanned | Repairs needed | Cityless repairs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `dev` | 146 | 146 | 0 |
| `staging` | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `prod` | 166 | 166 | 0 |

## Current Health

Verified in this consolidation pass from current code and registry state:

- Relationship arrays have already been retired from active app surfaces.
- `tool/data/validate_firestore_data.mjs` validates edge documents and parent
  aggregate drift instead of reconstructing from arrays.
- `createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `cancelEvent`, `deleteEvent`, club mutations,
  booking/waitlist/attendance, payments, reviews, safety actions, profile
  updates, Places, and event-success write paths are callable/trigger owned as
  documented in `docs/backend_operation_catalog.md`.
- Contract schemas now cover private/public profiles, events, clubs,
  relationship docs, social/payment/safety/operational docs, event-success
  documents, callable request payloads, selected responses, direct-write
  payloads, prompt catalogs, seed fixtures, and migration contracts.
- Event discovery projection fields are schema-owned, callable-owned, and have
  dry-run-first backfill tooling for older events.
- `tool/check_data_contract.sh` is the main local gate for generated drift,
  schema validation, Functions checks, rules tests, and focused Flutter
  contract tests.

## Event Model Rename And Remote Cleanup

Local naming has moved from run/run-club language to event/club language:

| Old name | Current name |
|---|---|
| `Run` | `Event` |
| `RunClub` | `Club` |
| `RunParticipation` | `EventParticipation` |
| `SavedRun` | `SavedEvent` |

The local rename is complete across Dart feature folders, domain classes,
repositories, routes, tests, Functions source folders, callable exports,
generated schema types, Firestore rules, indexes, contract schemas, seed tools,
repair tools, validation tools, and generated outputs.

Remote data cleanup is intentionally not complete. Do not delete or reset
Firestore data in dev, staging, or prod without a separate explicit
destructive-action confirmation. Preserve user documents and club documents
through any remote migration.

If remote cleanup is approved, first export or back up existing `users`,
`publicProfiles`, and old `runClubs` documents for each Firebase environment.
Then copy any host organizations worth preserving into `clubs`, reset
event-specific legacy collections and edges such as old `runs`,
`runParticipations`, `savedRuns`, reviews, event schedule locks, event-derived
profile decisions, and generated demo event documents, and re-run seed/host tooling against
the new `events` and `clubs` collections.

## Open Watch Items

- `RELATIONSHIP-DOC-MIGRATION`: watch only. Do not re-add retired arrays.
- `FIRESTORE-RULES-SIMPLIFICATION-001`: keep `users/{uid}` owner-readable only,
  decide the active club-membership read posture for member-list product needs,
  and keep the final direct writes intentionally narrow.
- `MIGRATION-VALIDATION-001`: before applying legacy migration scripts to
  shared beta data, add or keep seeded fixture tests for duplicates, missing
  docs, deleted users, legacy chats, and count mismatches.
- `DELETE-METHODOLOGY-QUEUE`: core account/event/club deletion is
  relationship-doc aware; broader historical event/club deletion still needs
  product policy before expanding beyond cancel/archive/delete-unused.
- Retired storage rename from `swipes` to `profileDecisions`: keep legacy
  migration/backfill tooling available for validation and cleanup, but do not
  reintroduce production reads or writes to `swipes/`.
- Retired grouped `ProfilePhoto` migration: profilePhotos is the canonical
  profile photo field after the 1.0.1 app-version floor. Keep legacy-array
  cleanup dry-run-first and do not reintroduce `photoUrls`,
  `photoThumbnailUrls`, or `photoPrompts` as canonical contract fields.
- Nested profile activity preferences: `activityPreferences.running` is the
  canonical home for pace, distance, reason, and run-time preferences. Domain
  decoders can tolerate legacy root fields until remote cleanup completes.

## Historical Evidence

Detailed phase logs and proof commands were moved out of active Markdown. Use
`docs/audit_registry/passes.jsonl`, `docs/audit_registry/files.jsonl`, and git
history when exact historical wording or old command output matters.
